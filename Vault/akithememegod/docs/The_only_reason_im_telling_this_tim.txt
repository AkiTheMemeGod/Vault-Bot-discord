The only reason im telling this time is that i dont want to hurt u by not letting you know because that would be too cruel to you.. to wait for me to text back and me to leave you hanging.. its hard for me.. but harder to see us both get hurt every single time.. i might message you when i think we both might be in a better place… this sounds awful lot like a breakup but it isnt because its something worse..  you can message me too just to checkup on me but i clearly dont see a way where we both can continue msging everyday.. and tbh i feel like there are more people than just us who are involved in our friendship and its making it quite bitter and the confusions are too much to handle..  i will miss you and im sure you will do well in life.. All the best! P.S. im not mad.. and im not gonna be rude when i see you next time..  i will talk normally because i dont have any hard feelings.. im just stating all this so that you can be clear and please dont be upset.. if you really really miss me just text hi..  and its not like our friendship is over… i think we both need a break from each other..




hi i wanted to tell you something..since we started drifting apart i realized the feelings i had towards you was just wasnt friendship...and tbh i feel like there are more people than just us who are involved in our friendship.Thank you for being a great friend and always being there for me.No hard feelings...
